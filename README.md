The project aims to provide insights into the underlying patterns, properties, and behaviours of a network, contributing to a deeper understanding of its functioning.
                    The main focus is the analysis of Italian theatrical scripts; situating the reserach in the field of Literary Studies, a sector concerned with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of a literary piece. For this project's scope, our study considers Eduardo De Filippoâ€™s comedy Filumena Marturano, adopting tools and methods of data acquisition and interaction analysis between the characters.
